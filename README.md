Football Time - Turing School, Mod 3 FEE Solo Project

Footbal Time is the last project of Mod 3 of the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design. For this project, I used Redux and fetched data from premade APIs.

The App shows the matches of the five most significant European leagues, the events updating live and the user can change the date to see the matches in past or upcoming games. Also, users can choose games using their favorite league's name and search for their team.
